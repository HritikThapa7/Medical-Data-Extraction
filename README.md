## How to run:
1 - Open extract.ipynb file for extracting data from raw data(data1.xlsx).    
2 - Run the file to get the data in structured form(test.csv).      
           
Note: One can extract structured data using raw data: big_data.txt and small_data.txt by uncommenting another code below         
    
3 - For visualization, run Data_visualization.ipynb.
